# Safety-Case Help: Contents #

A **safety case** is a structured argument, supported by a body of evidence that
provides a compelling, comprehensible and valid case that a system is safe for a
given application in a given operating environment[^fn1]. Additional detail is
found in the [Safety-Case Technology](safety-case.html#contents) Section.

## Argument Viewer ##
Documentation for the Argument Viewer is organized according to the menus 
present in the viewer:

* [View Menu](view.html#contents)
* [Focus Menu](focus.html#contents)

### General Usage ###

The Argument Viewer behaves similarly to Google Maps: zooming is effected with
the scroll wheel and panning is effected by clicking and dragging on the 
argument's background (when the pointer shows an open hand).

### Selection ###

A number of viewer's features require that an element be selected. Selection
is achieved by positioning the pointer over an element (so it turns blue) and
clicking the mouse once. The element will then turn green, indicating that it
is selected.
  
Only one element can be selected at a time.

Items that have a hyperlink cannot be clicked using the left mouse button,
as this follows the hyperlink. For these items, clicking the right mouse
button is an effective way to select them.

Selection can be cleared by clicking once on the background of the argument
(when the pointer shows an open hand).
