# Purpose #

The purpose of this case is to demonstrate the capabilities of the toolset. More
text can be found in the document describing 
[safety-case technology](../help/safety-case.html#contents), the source file for which shows how 
arguments and figures can be added to your documents. That document is reusable
across cases and should require little editing.

Arguments can be included in text documents. The argument shown in 
Figure [metadata-example] contains metadata, although the metadata is not
displayed to the viewer when the case has been built.

<p> <arg id="metadata-example" /> </p>

The argument shown in Figure [system] does not contain metadata. Like the
argument shown in Figure [metadata-example], it is interactive.

<p> <arg id="system" /> </p>
