## Reset [reset] ##

The “Reset” option zooms and centers the argument to its “natural” size so
that it comfortably fits in the browser window.
  
## 1-to-1 [1-to-1] ##

The “1-to-1” option zooms the argument to “100%” around its center. If the
argument is small and the browser window is large, this may not alter the
zoom relative to the “Reset” option.
  
## Begin/End Narration [narration] ##

Starting with the selected element, the viewer will present narration 
that explains the logic and content of the argument. 

Note that the arguments in the current version of the safety case do not at
present have narration. This is a feature that will be exploited in coming
releases.
  
## Show/Hide Overview [overview] ##

Show or hide the overview, or splash screen, that appears when an argument
is first loaded.
  
## Hide Navigator [hide-navigator] ##

The navigator (or mini-map) can be repositioned by clicking on the triangles
in its corners. It will anchor itself to the corresponding corner of the 
browser window. 

Sometimes, the navigator can't be positioned in any corner without occluding
the argument. The “Hide Navigator” option allows it to be dismissed. It can
be returned by selecting the same option again (which will now read “Show
Navigator”).
